Well this road will probably end in my doom in this age of information but I'd rather browse free on fresh certificates than have to be trapped in the Internet of my youth. Sure it's nostalgic but I prefer to live in reality so please guide this stubborn windows user on the ways of the new forefront of Linux and let the mirrors and shells be destroyed as the tunnels collapse around it.
